## What’s One Thing You’d Tell Someone Starting This Course?

something I would tell someone starting this course is that the end of the course has more work than the beginning, so plan accordingly

## What Did You Learn That Might Stick With You?

Something that will stick with me is that you can't code while tired, hungry, and frustrated, and that the best thing you can do is eat and get some rest.

## What Helped You Get Through Challenges?

Asking for help, whether from my Dad, or from the Clangen discord.

## What’s Next for You?

I might continue the mod, giving it more features.
