### What I Set Out to Do
I am going to debug and get the interpret_phenotype() function working, and then work on implementing the genes into the cat's data

---

### What I Actually Did

I debugged interpret_phenotpe() (I needed a [0]). I also changed the mutations file into a mutations class, to make it easier to access (and because
most other things in the game code are classes)

---

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that self in OOPs are very finnicky, and only work if you set the class as a variable (for some reason)

---

### What's Next

next I'm gonna try to find where the cats data is created, and implement the mutation code
