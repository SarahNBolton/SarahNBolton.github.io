### What I Set Out to Do
I was aiming to just start on it, and see how much I could do

---

### What I Actually Did

After much struggling with actually getting the code to work on visual studio code (including actually downloading visual studio code bc I only had visual studio which didn't work), I made a mutations.py that has a dictionary with all the different mutations and working on implementing them
---

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned how to call upon code in a different file (when debugging)

---

### What's Next

actually get the funciton that randomly generates a cat's mutations to work
