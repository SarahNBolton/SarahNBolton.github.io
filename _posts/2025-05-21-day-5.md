### What I Actually Did

After trying all day, and rereading my proposal and realizing that i never actually said I was going to do that, I decided to just skip it, 
as I'm running out of time. I instead moved onto the sprites, which I also didn't do a whole lot on, just one alt spritesheet as I realized 
the sheer amount of sprites I'd have to make. I left off on trying to implement it only sometimes (so that not all the cats have the alt sprites,
just the ones with wings, as the alt sprite is cats with wings).

### What I Learned or Noticed

I leanred that it's okay to not be able to do anything, as long as you can do the bare minimum its okay
