### What I Set Out to Do
I'm gonna find where the cat's data is being generated and put the mutation code into it
---

### What I Actually Did

I asked for help on the Clangen discord (I asked for where the data is being generated)

---

### What I Learned or Noticed

I learned that it's okay to ask for help, and its better to ask for help than look around aimlessly

---

### What's Next

get the feedback and then actually implement the mutations
