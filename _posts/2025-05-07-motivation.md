### Project Focus

This project is named 'Wastegen'. It is a mod for Clangen, an open-source Warrior cats fangame, that adds mutations such as wings, horns, extra tails, and spines. It is based off of WasteClan on TikTok.

---

### Why This Project 

I've been playing Clangen for a while now, and have wanted to make a mod for it. I've also been watching WasteClan, and after learning that there isn't a mod, decided to make one myself.

---

### What I Want to Learn

I want to learn how to use pygame a python module which Clangen runs on.


### My Approach 

I'm gonna make the dictionary of the different mutations a cat can have, as well as implementing an inheritance/gene system, and make (at the very least) placeholder sprites so you can tell what mutations a cat has by looking at it (you don't have to go into the save file code to check).

### What's Next

Implement the mutations into a dictionary
