## About Me

Hi, I'm Sarah, a student interested in cats and genetics.  
This project was part of my final quest in Computer Programming Spring 2025, and it reflects what I’ve learned about dictionaries and pygame.

## About My Project

**Project Title:** *Wastegen*   
**One-line pitch:** A clangen mod with mutations (such as extra tails, wings, etc.), based off of Wasteclan on TikTok
